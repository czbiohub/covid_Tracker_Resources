# Truseq tail 400 bp amplicon set analysis. (2 x 250 bp run)

### purpose : the goal of this analysis was to test the ARTIC truseq tail primers that Eric designed in comparison with the tagmentation method. 

#### Approach : 

1. performed truseq tail method on seq 52 and seq 53 cDNA plate (cDNA was diluted 1:1- 5 ul was used for tagmentation and 5 ul was used for Truseq ARTIC tail) 
    + conditions for multiplex cycle was the same : 30 cycles.
    + pool (A + B) was diluted to 1:100 and 0.5 ul input was used for index PCR (same as tagmentation method).
    + index PCR conditions :
    
      Step    | Temp	| Time	| Cycle
      --------|-------|-------|-------
      Step 1	| 98°C 	| 30 s  |	1
      Step 2 	| 98°C 	| 10 s  |	10
      Step 3	| 65°C 	| 75 s	|
      Step 4	| 65°C 	| 5 mins| 1
      Step 5	| 4°C 	| hold	| 1
      
        

2. Analyze data in comparison with tagmentation method
