# Invitae hybrid capture sequencing analysis (Author : Karan Bhatt)

## purpose : the goal of this analysis was to compare the hybrid capture sequencing method with the same samples previously sequenced using ARTIC tagmentation method. 

### approach : 

1. Data processing.
    + Run sc2-illumina-pipeline on FASTQs provided by Invitae. 

2. compare the standard QC criteria.
    + Look at normalized mapped reads. 
    + Look at genome recovery.
    + Look at coverage plots 
    

3. Upload consensus on nextclade and compare SNPs, clades, and tree placement.
